# HackED: Adventure Cat Damion
For HackED2019 we decided to create an interactive browser-based story game!  
Welcome to **Adventure Cat Damion**, where the choices you make in the game will affect the story!  


# Write the Scripts for this game
Before going into the code, our group wanted to ensure that we had a solid design that would be easy to follow in the implementation steps. 

The objective of the hackathon was to create a kid-friendly game, and learn as much React.js as possible.

You can find the flow/design of the script here: [wiki](https://github.com/starryEcliipse/HackED2019/wiki) 


# Requirement
Basic HTML, CSS, JS, Linux, Git.


# Prepare the Environment
## Npm
We need to setup the ReactJS on our machine. I wrote this guide for MacOS.
(1) Since you are going to use JavaScript for your React development on MacOS, there is no way around Node.js and NPM. 
(2) Download Node.js and NPM.
(3)Run this line in the terminal : npm install -g create-react-app.
(4)You can check its version again on the command line : create-react-app --version.
(5)You can use create-react-app by passing the name of your application to it on the command line:
create-react-app my-app.
(6)Afterward, you can navigate into the project on the command line and start it with npm:
cd my-app/npm start
(7)Finish set the environment.

# File Descriptions
1. mySpider/ (Python module for a project that references code from here)
2. mySpider/items.py (sets the data module for structured data)
3. mySpider/pipelines.py (data processing)
4. mySpider/spiders (directions of spiders code)
5. scrapy.cfg & mySpider/settings.py (project configuration information and files)
